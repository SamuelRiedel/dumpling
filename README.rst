An vector generation library and command line tool for the HP93000 ASIC tester


Description
===========

Dumpling provides a python library and a command line interface to simplify the
process of generating vectors for the HP93000 ASIC tester in AVC format. It
currently support the commonly used PULPJTAG and RISC-V debug interface for
high-level chip interaction but can be extended easily to support other
JTAGTaps, entirely different Protocols or additional output formats besides the
AVC vector file format.
